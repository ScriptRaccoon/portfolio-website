# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://scriptraccoon.dev](https://scriptraccoon.dev)

It features:

- a selection of my best personal web development projects
- a blog with thoughts and tutorials on web development
- an overview of my YouTube channel
- personal information about me

The website is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). Channel statistics are updated automatically through a GitHub Action that queries the YouTube Data API.
