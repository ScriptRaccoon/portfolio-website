<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
	Before coming to web development, I devoted most years of my life to <strong
		>pure mathematics</strong
	>, which is one of my biggest passions and strongest skills. I
	worked at the university and completed my Ph.D. about ten years ago.
	Afterward, I left academia, but I still publish research articles
	from time to time. I also published a textbook on the field of my
	expertise. 📚
</p>

<p>
	After leaving university, I spent several years in animal rights and
	environmental <strong>activism</strong> and also worked as an IT
	admin in a non-profit organization. In this context, I learned the
	basics of web development and devoted most of my free time on it
	since 2019. I also observed many parallels between mathematics and
	web development and my problem-solving skills helped me a lot.
	Around that time I also created my
	<a href="/youtube"><strong>YouTube channel</strong></a>. 💻
</p>

<p>
	I got my first job as a full stack <strong>web developer</strong> in
	late 2022. I work for a company in the sports retail industry. See
	<a href="/skills">Skills</a> for a more complete list of my web development
	skills. 🧪
</p>

<p>
	On YouTube and Twitter I go by the name
	<strong>Script Raccoon</strong>. My first name is Martin, but online
	in the context of web development, I prefer the name Script Raccoon.
	And yes, raccoons are my favorite animals! 🦝
</p>
<p>
	When I am not sitting at my laptop coding SvelteKit apps, you can
	probably find me in the rehearsal room <strong
		>playing the drums</strong
	>. 🥁
