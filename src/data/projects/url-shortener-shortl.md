_ShortL_ is a URL shortner made with SvelteKit and SQLite (hosted on Turso).

After creation of a short URL, a password-protected admin page is created where the visits can be evaluated. Also, the short URL can be deleted from there again.

**Notice.** I have made [another URL shortener](http://localhost:5173/projects/url-shortener) before (with MongoDB, and without analytics).
