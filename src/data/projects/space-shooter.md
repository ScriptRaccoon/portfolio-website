This is a space shooter game, made with Vanilla JavaScript and an object-oriented design.

You navigate a spaceship through space and shoot asteroids with lasers. There are three types of asteroids, the smaller ones give higher scores.

The stars in the background show a parallax effect, therefore the name. This is realized by using multiple HTML canvases on top of each other.

The animations are realized in the same way as in the project [Sprite animations](/projects/sprite-animations).
