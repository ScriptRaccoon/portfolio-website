Group theory is a fascinating branch of pure mathematics, which allows us to understand arithmetical operations, solutions of algebraic equations, symmetries of geometric objects, cryptographic algorithms, and much more.

This repository develops basic group theory with TypeScript. In particular, we make use of generic classes to develop abstract mathematical concepts, such as groups, homomorphisms of groups, and subgroups. Several examples are studied and tested.

The project is discussed in detail in a series of blog posts, starting with [Part 1](/blog/grouptheory-typescript-part1).
