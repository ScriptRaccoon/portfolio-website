In the paid version of [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) the training log is a very useful feature. Unfortunately, it's not available in the free version. This repository makes it possible to build it yourself.

The diary lists all your runs as "bubbles" whose sizes correspond to the total amount of kilometers on that day. By clicking on them you get a more detailed overview of the runs. They are linked to the respective Strava pages with more details.

The app is made with Svelte. The runs are retrieved from a CSV file. The responsive design makes it possible to use the app on a phone as well. I put my run diary on the phone's start screen.

See the repository's README for how to set it up on your account.
