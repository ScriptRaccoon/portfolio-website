This is a simple chat app made with Svelte on the front-end and Express on the back-end. Socket.IO is used for real-time communication between clients.

Express serves the dist folder of the built Svelte application. The development process is facilitated with various scripts in the `package.json` file.

Bot messages inform users about new or leaving users. There is a separate view showing the list of all users. Of course, the app is accessible for keyboard navigation.

I also made a [similar project](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/sveltekit-chat-app) with SvelteKit.
