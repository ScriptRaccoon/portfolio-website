This is a (not so basic) to-do app made with Svelte, featuring, in particular, many of the built-in animations of Svelte, which brings a great user experience.

You can create several lists of tasks. Each task has a name, priority, and status. Each task can be deleted or moved to a different list. The order of the tasks can be changed. Each list can be sorted by priority or alphabetically and filtered for completed status. Of course, it can also be renamed and deleted.

There is also a list of all tasks (when you have created at least two lists). Naturally, you cannot delete that list or add tasks to it.

This is a pure front-end application. The lists are saved in the local storage of your browser.
