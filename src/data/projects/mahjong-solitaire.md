This is the classical Mahjong solitaire game as a browser game written with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. You have to select pairs of identical open tiles to remove them from the board. The game is won when no tiles are left.

The status bar shows you how many moves are available. You can also get a hint for a possible move, get info about the rules of the game, or restart the game.

The design is responsive so that you can also play the game on mobile devices.

It was quite a challenge to create the 3-dimensional look of the cards with CSS alone.
