This is a basic weather app made with SvelteKit. The data is retrieved from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). The following features of SvelteKit are used:

- components
    - scoped styles
- (nested) routes
- layout
- server-side rendering
    - the app still works when disabling JS on the client
- page load
    - fetch API data
    - environment variables
