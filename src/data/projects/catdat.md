- **Reason/Reference for Implications**: Each implication has a reason/reference, providing a data-based knowledge base of category theory.
- **Automatic Dualization**: Automatically dualizes implications.
- **Comprehensive Definitions**: Detailed definitions of properties and categories.
- **Comparison Feature**: Compare multiple categories to see their differences.
- **Find Related Categories**: Discover categories related to your search.
- **Customizable Display**: Light/dark mode, show/hide deduced properties.
- **References to nLab**: Links to the [nLab](https://ncatlab.org) for detailed information.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy to use on both mobile and desktop.
