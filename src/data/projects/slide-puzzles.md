This is the classical 4 &times; 4 slide puzzle as a browser game, which can be resized up to 10 &times; 10 tiles. It is made with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS and features nice graphics and smooth animations.

Apart from changing the size, you can scramble the game, and you can also start a challenge that measures the time you need to complete the puzzle. Your high score is saved in the local storage of the browser.
